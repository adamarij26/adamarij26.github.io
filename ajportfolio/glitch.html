<p>This is my personal story to share on my glitch art piece. I was raised in San Jose, California but had to moved unexpectedly when I was 15 years old and moved to the Central Valley to Merced. There I had to explore a brand new city and new area by myself and it was very difficult but it worked out all in the end. When it came around to choosing what university I wanted to transfer to, I really wanted to go back to the city that I had to move away from, and coming back can bring me into more experiences and the endless possibilities in a bigger city such as San Jose. And I'm glad being back. The glitched art shares the transition of looking back when going forward, the city of Merced, and the different pathways for me to choose from.</p>
